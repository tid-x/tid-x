biography: |
    First thing Roberto remembers is to play with a ZX Spectrum, after this, he thinks that he didn't get away of a computer keyboard.

    Nowadays during the day he works at Tokbox doing many things but tries to not leave the Mobile devices world. During the night he is converted to a retro computing fan and spends a lot of time with Commodore or Atari machines.

    To not leave the iOS and Android world, he also tries to run a small startup called meronapps where, with the help of his wife, do applications for Mobile devices and smart watches.
