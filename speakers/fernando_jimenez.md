biography: |
    Fernando works as a Senior Research Engineer at Mozilla building Servo, the next generation web browser engine.

    Among other things, he helped building an open source mobile operating system (Firefox OS), a famous web browser (Firefox) and the first parallel CSS engine (Stylo in Firefox Quantum). However, he is most proud of his latest release: a fork of himself in the form of a beautiful baby named Juan.

    Past companies - Alba Fotónica & Telefónica.

    His hobbies used to include reading tons of books, running, swimming or riding his beloved triathlon bike, but he is now easily seen pushing a stroller and singing lullabies.
