biography: |
    Software Engineer at Okteto, building a self-service ephemeral environment platform that empowers developers to unlock their innovation instead of setting up environments.

    Experienced in product-driven system design, expert in Kubernetes and Public Cloud Posture security. Occasionally sporting an aluminum hat – digital skepticism is key.

    Passionate about sharing tech findings, history novels, and drones (wannabe FPV pilot).

    Previously at: BQ (Spanish mobile OEM, building a cost-savvy OTA platform), Telefonica i+D/CDO (contributing to the 4th Platform), and 11Paths/Telefonica Tech (working on tech security B2B/B2C products).
