biography: |
    I'm a test automation engineer with 8 years of experience.

    I did FE/BE/Mobile automation, process automation, continuous delivery, and more in Python, Java and Node.js.

    I was a manual tester, test automation engineer, test lead, scrum master, QA mentor, business analyst and QA community master.

    I'm now trying to make testing in the banking sector realize it's the 21 century already :P
